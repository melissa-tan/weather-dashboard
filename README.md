# weather-dashboard
This repository contains a web application made with html, css, javascript, focusing on the server side API [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
This weather dashboard allows a user to search for the weather conditions of a city. The user will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. There is also a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. The user's input is saved into localStorage and the user can click on any previous searches or clear history.
